## ⚡️ How it works (core flow)

1. **Donors:** Add surplus food → choose donor type → fill in food details → upload photo → confirm.
2. **AI Surplus Matcher:** Auto-matches surplus to the best verified hub near the donor.
3. **Volunteers:** Get notified by WhatsApp → accept task → see grouped routes → deliver → slide-to-complete with photo proof.
4. **Recipients:** Verified orgs get matched only within their capacity. Families/individuals can claim directly too.
5. **Impact:** Total food saved, meals created, and volunteer points shown in dashboards.
